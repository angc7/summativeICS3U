# sweetswap
Sweetswap, my version of "Candy Crush", coded for ICS3U summative in Java.
Includes timer threading and features a leaderboard, failsafes for incorrect matches, and constant checking for possible combos (game will automatically end when there are none).
GUI with extensive code revolving around 2-D arrays.
